        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Elizabeth Safar. I am currently completing my undergraduate degree at the University of California, Riverside. I am an Education major, and I am very passionate about the subject. My commitment to being an advocate and leader in the field of education began in high school, where I got to some volunteer work with the LGBTQ+ community. Meeting homeless youth, helping them on their journey of finding home, happiness, and stability, showed me that my path in life involves helping people reach their fullest potential. I love working with groups, and I thrive in environments where interacting with people is required.
<br><br>

        I am very well organized, goal-oriented and I always keep leading by example in mind. I am a community college transfer student, and I worked several jobs while completing my transfer credits, an experience that has prepared me for working hard and maintaining a work life balance. My multiple sales jobs, and working for large companies with high expectations has prepared me to handle even the toughest and diffuse those situations with kindness and care. My volunteer work with the LGBTQ+ Homeless shelter taught me compassion and how to communicate with trauma informed care in mind. I believe that this level of care is crucial to having meaningful and successful interactions with people in general, but is especially important when dealing with students. In addition to working, maintaining a full time schedule, and mentoring my siblings who are now on their way to matriculating from community colleges to universities. 
<br><br>

        I also volunteering with my former community college, shadowing and helping with the very program that helped me gain a strong footing in education and is responsible for my success thus far, the FYE (First year experience) program. Giving back and helping students with their academic journey is absolute joy and honor that consistently helps me reaffirm that I am on the right path. I hope to soon help students out with their college journey weather that is in a 2-year community college or a 4-year university, everyone has their own experience and I hope to make it easier for them. Doing a lot for my community especially for first-generation students and being more diverse because they are the most targeted group to help especially first-generation students because they do not have enough information or resources to apply to college or know how to apply. Having all my skill and experience will help me get to where I want to be which is a person who helps students in a diverse community to get to their dreams and success. It is an accomplishment to know that you have the information and resources and not feeling lost in the system and knowing people care enough to help you go through college. I am not a first-generation student but I do have many friends who are and using the knowledge I know by my siblings helping me and then helping m friends who do not have the resource feels amazing.
